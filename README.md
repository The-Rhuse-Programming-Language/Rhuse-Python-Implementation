# As of now, Rhuse has yet to be implemented. I am making it as of 2-20-26. By the end of today, it should be implemented.

## Roadmap
* 2-20-26: Implement basic I/O and math features (Completed by Adam)
* 2-21-26 to 3-1-26: Implement import system (Adam will work on it; Trevor, you are free to help if you want.)
* 3-2-26 to 4-1-26: Finish the book implementing Rhuse (Adam's personal project, no involvement needed from others but is welcome to advice)


# Roadmap Review

Adam- LGTM
